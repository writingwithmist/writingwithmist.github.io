## I Do Not Deserve Someone Like You

Hi. I love you. I love you so much and I want to give all the happiness in this world, only for you.
The thing is, I do not deserve someone that kind, pure and good like you.
You have beautiful soul and pure kindness, whereas I am bad person.
I am really-really bad person.
Is it okay if I still have a hope? Maybe just an empty hope. 
I like to imagine that we are together, till the end of time.
That we're dance together, like we used to.
But, I do not deserve you. I do not deserve someone as good as you.
