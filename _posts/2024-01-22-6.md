Hi,

Kiddo, this is the story of how I miss your mother.

However, I need you to know that I hurt your mother a lot and I am lucky that she's still here. I don't think that I deserve her for all the world.
Your mother is the most amazing women you ever known and we're very lucky to have her in our life. Is it fun to hear her voice every night?
Is it nice to saw her big eyes? I know right.

I miss her a lot. Now, your father is struggling with econometrics and everything about academia.
And your mother still hurt after our last conversation. 
Kiddo, I am not the best man in the world and I don't know. I want to be with your mother all the time. But, I do not have courage to ask her that.
Please kiddo, pray for your father? pray for me that your mother will never leave me.
