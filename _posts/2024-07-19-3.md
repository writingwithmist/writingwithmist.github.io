## Today, I tell My Mom that I miss you

It is kinda weird to talk personal stuff with my Mom. I need to say it to someone that I miss you so much.
But, who should I talk to? Considering I'm not only hurting you, but also the people that care about you?
My Mom is very supportive and guess what? She loves you. I'm sorry Mom, I have to dissapoint you by not taking such a good care of good and kind girl like you.
I wish that someday you will forgive me. Can I get an ameen?
